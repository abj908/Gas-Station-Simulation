# Gas-Station-Simulation

Our objectives for this project were to simulate a model in an arena for 4 double sided gas machines with the given resources, costs, profits, constraints, and arrival rates. Using the same model we are then inputting the best distribution for the given interarrival times of cars for the weekend and weekday and comparing it with another model using a distribution of EXPO(2.75) minutes. We are then finding the profits that each of the models produces and comparing them. ARENA, Matlab, and Excel were used on this project.
